## Repository Layout

### `const/`

The founding documents. What PRAGMA is, why it operates the way it does, and the values that define the institution. Changes to these documents require a separate deliberation process with the highest bar for unanimity.

- **[pragma.md](const/pragma.md)** - The founding document. Values, process, and scope. Start here.
- **[pragma-once.md](const/pragma-once.md)** - The strategy document. Single scope, the five values, and the argument behind the posture.
- **[pragma-pack.md](const/pragma-pack.md)** - The composition document. Structure, roles, and the principle that evaluation capability resides in the members.

### `process/`

How the group works day to day. Decisions, open questions, operational principles. This is the group's working memory.

- **[pragma-next.md](process/pragma-next.md)** - The operational log. Changes rapidly, especially in early periods.

### `props/`

PRAGMA Proposals. Numbered proposals that modify PRAGMA documents through group unanimity. The PROP process governs itself.

- **[PROP-000.md](props/PROP-000.md)** - The PROP protocol. Defines the format, lifecycle, and rules for all subsequent PROPs.
- **[PROP-001.md](props/PROP-001.md)** - The agentic condensation rule. Applied to PROP submissions before group review.
- **[PROP-002.md](props/PROP-002.md)** - Commit message questions. Five questions every commit must answer.
- **[PROP-003.md](props/PROP-003.md)** - Membership lifecycle. Size cap, inactivity timeout, emeritus status, succession.

### `chair/`

The chair's working directory. The chair determines its contents. Includes an inbox for formal suggestions and any process materials the chair maintains. Transfers intact on succession.

- **[inbox/](chair/inbox/)** - Proposals for the chair to consider. No suggestion implies obligation.
